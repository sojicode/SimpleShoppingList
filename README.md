## iOS - Simple Shopping List


### Goals
* Explore Xcode and build an app with text input fields
* Explore UIKit documentation

### Tasks
1. Create a simple Shopping List app.

2. The New List button will create a new empty shopping list.The contents of the current shopping list will be lost.

3. The New Item button will clear any content in the two text fields.

4. The text field next to Description allows you to type the description of an item to be added to the shopping list. The action button on the soft keyword should dismiss the keyboard.

5. The text field next to Quantity allows you to type the quantity of an item to be added to the shopping list. It should use a numeric keypad to input the numbers. The keypad should be dismissed with a tap in the background.

6. The Add button adds a new item to the shopping list based on the description and quantity in the text fields. The contents of the shopping should be displayed in the lower portion of the screen, one line per item, as shown in the screenshot above. The items should be in the order in which they are entered.

7. You should use auto layout for this assignment.

8. You should check for any invalid input in the text fields, when the Add button is tapped. You should ensure that neither input is empty, and the quantity field is an integer. An alert popup should be displayed when invalid input is found, and no item will be added when the input is invalid.
